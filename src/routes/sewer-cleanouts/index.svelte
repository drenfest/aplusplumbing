<h2>Sewer Cleanouts  – Installation and Service</h2>
<p>A sewer clean out is a significant part of your house’s plumbing and disposal. Every homeowner should understand where the sewer clean out is situated.</p>
<p>The sewer clean out is a pipe that has a cap on it.  This cap provides access to the sewer line so that blockages can be removed.  This is typically called the lateral sewer line.  The lateral sewer line connects your home to the public city sewer.  The lateral sewer line clean out typically is your responsibility. Make sure you have a certified licensed plumber inspect and clean out your lateral sewer line.  A+ Rooter Inc. Plumbing are experts at sewer clean outs.</p>
<p>The public sewer system is preserved by the regional municipality. The town accounts for removing and cleaning blockages from these lines. </p>
<p>Sewer clean outs might be found at multiple points across the lateral sewer line. There’s typically a clean outside near the house itself, or close to the home line, or even both.</p>
<p>It’s crucial that you understand where the sewage clean out is situated so you could access it quickly if there’s an issue. You need to make an effort and maintain the region around the sewer clean out  so you may access it easily.  </p>
