<h3>Hydro-Jetting Sewer & Drain Lines</h3>
<p>Hydro-jetting utilizes back-jets of water, coming from the nozzle head attached to the lead edge of the cable, with strong water pressure to propel the cable down the pipe. The leading jets of this nozzle blast blockages out of the way. The water pressure is about 4,000 PSI.  This is enough water pressure to push tree roots out of the way.</p>
<p>Since hydro-jetting does not utilize a sharp metal cutting head and uses water pressure rather, there’s a much less likely prospect of damage to the sewer lines. Hydro-jetting is the most effective means to clear underground pipes that are from 1 1/2 to 24 inches in diameter.</p>
