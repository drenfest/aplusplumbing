Let us explain to you what power rodding is. </p>
<p>Power rodding works like Hydro-Jetting.  Power rodding has actually been around longer.  It was the alternative to digging out a pipe and replacing it with new.    </p>
<p>How power rodding works is similar to sticking a flexible metal cable with a sharp cutting tool at the end of it that is smaller than the diameter of the pipe that needs to be cleared.  Our professional technicians push the cable turning it thru the pipe, until it is stopped by the blockage.  </p>
<p>The metal cutting edge of the power rodder is now put into motion.  By activating the motor it will rotate the cable while it spins at a high speed allowing the sharp teeth to cut through any roots or debris.</p>
<p>The benefit of rodding is that it allows us to cut through large blockages clearing out anything in the way.  It creates a larger opening and is better than using a snake which only creates a small hole through the blockage.  </p>
