<h2>Flood control systems</h2>
<p>If you live in Chicago or the suburbs you probably already understand our flood control options due to the fact we have an antiquated water sewer system that constantly is backing up; sometimes flooding your home or business. This problem is so severe that you can learn more about it on the City of Chicago website just <a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/water/supp_info/basement_floodingpartnership.html" title="City Of Chicago Flood Problems">click here.</a></p>
<h3>There are several different tyupes of flood control systems:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Lift Station Pumping System</li>
	<li>Overhead Sewer Flood Control System</li>
	<li>Check Valve</li>
	<li>Drainage Tile System</li>
</ul>
<p> Basements flood for multiple reasons perhaps it’s a broken sump pump, maybe you have the wrong size of sump pump or your sewer line may have an issue. Living in the Chicago area we get torrential downpours along with snowmelt, and flooding rivers when this happens, the city sewer can’t handle this amount of water. Our sewers flood over capacity and you as the homeowner can’t prevent rainwater backing up in your home or basement.</p>
<p>The older sewer systems can be upgraded to prevent sanitary sewer backups into the basement. Flood control systems are well worth it in the long run, As long as it’s maintenance yearly along with your sewer system.</p>
