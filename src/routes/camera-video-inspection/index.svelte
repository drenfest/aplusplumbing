<h2>Camera / Video Inspection</h2>
<h3>Providing camera location services</h3>
<p>Video cameras are becoming among the most valuable tools in the plumbing business. Notably made watertight cameras allow for a visual inspection of sewer lines, drains and other pipes that are underground, in cement or beneath your home’s foundation.</p>
<p>At A+ Rooter Plumbing our professionally trained and skilled technicians insert a flexible rod with a high-resolution video camera on its tip.  We insert the camera into the sewer or drain ranging from two inches to 36 inches in diameter. The elastic pole allows the camera to traveling through the tube– even around corners–to observe the pipe in its entirety. Real-time video image processing allows the technician to ascertain the condition of the inside of the pipe and also comprehend potential or existing problems.</p>
